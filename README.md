Surf School is project I created using React, Redux and Firebase.

The project is not finished yet.

I want to create a virtual Surf School that will allow every instructor to create their own profile, and they can choose if they want to give Group, Private or Personalized lessons.
They can set their own price for the lessons, the level they want to teach, the maximum of students per lessons and the minimum for that lesson to take place. 

On the students side they are going to be able to search for instructors in the location that they specify and apply the different filters to find the right instructor. They will be able to contact an instructor before and after booking a lesson as well.
